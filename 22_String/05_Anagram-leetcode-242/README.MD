in anagram problem we see that if there is two word is there then to form the one word whatever letter is used , that all should be present in another one and equal number of latter should be there , 

-same latter should be in both word 
-equl number of lartter should be there also 


How I will sholve the proble 
-see no. of latter in both word is equl or not if not then reutrn false ;
-now short both the word 
-check both equal or not
